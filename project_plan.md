Alright, I need to help the user by generating a main tasks list for their Multi AI System project. The project aims to integrate home security and daily conversation using AI with ROS2 as the backbone. It includes front-end design, backend server setup, ROS2 pipelines, hardware integration, AI models, and an LLM-based automation system.

First, I should break down each main section of the project and identify the critical tasks within them. Starting with the frontend, which involves real-time monitoring dashboards and user interface improvements. Then moving to the backend, focusing on data streaming, API connections, and authentication systems.

Next is the ROS2 pipeline design, where modular server architecture and event processing are key areas. The hardware section includes setting up webcam and speaker functionality along with edge computing optimizations. For AI, developing a fall detection model using keypoints and integrating it with object tracking systems like YOLO and MOT. Finally, designing an LLM pipeline for automation tasks.

I should also consider additional tasks that tie everything together, such as project documentation, testing, deployment, budget planning, risk management, and user training. Each task should be detailed enough to guide the user through development without being overly verbose.

It's important to ensure that each task addresses a specific part of the project description provided by the user. I'll organize them into clear headings for easy navigation and reference.

## 마일스톤

Alright, I need to help the user by generating a main tasks list for their Multi AI System project based on the provided project description and milestones. The goal is to create a clear and organized list of key tasks that will guide them through the development process.

First, I'll review the project overview which mentions developing an AI-based system that integrates home security with daily conversation using ROS2 as the backbone. This involves front-end design for monitoring dashboards, backend server setup for data streaming and API connections, ROS2 pipeline implementation for modular server architecture and event processing, hardware integration for webcam and speaker functionality, AI model development for fall detection using keypoints and object tracking systems like YOLO and MOT, and an LLM-based automation system.

Next, I'll break down each section of the project to identify critical tasks. For the frontend, it's about creating real-time monitoring dashboards and improving user interface (UI) and experience (UX). In the backend, the focus is on data streaming, API connections, authentication systems, etc. The ROS2 pipeline will involve designing modular server architecture and implementing event processing with services.

Hardware integration includes setting up webcam and speaker functionality along with edge computing optimizations using Raspberry Pi. AI development entails building a fall detection model using keypoints combined with pose estimation data and integrating object tracking models like YOLO and MOT for enhanced accuracy. The LLM pipeline will involve developing an efficient language model using DeepSeek-R1, integrating it into an automation system that can trigger actions based on AI predictions.

Additional tasks include documentation to support future development, deployment and testing phases where the system is tested in real-world scenarios and bugs are fixed. Finally, budget planning and risk management ensure resources are allocated efficiently, and user training helps users understand how to interact with the system effectively.

Each task should be detailed enough to guide the user but concise enough to avoid being overwhelming. By organizing these tasks under main categories like frontend development, backend setup, ROS2 pipeline design, AI integration, LLM automation, testing & deployment, documentation, budget planning, risk management, and user training, it becomes easier for the user to follow along.

I'll also consider any dependencies or potential challenges between tasks, ensuring that each step is logically ordered. For example, starting with the frontend ensures that data from other components can be displayed effectively before moving on to backend setup.

Finally, I'll make sure the language is clear and straightforward, avoiding unnecessary jargon while still being detailed enough for someone with a technical background to understand each component's role in the overall project.
